# AsterboidsCore

 Intention of this project is to bring a boiding protocol, which are very common in C#, into the Unity DOTS system. 

The basic boids core implementation was taken from here: https://github.com/keijiro/Boids/tree/7eb25a1a5a65a04427bbb4070184c59a4af7b354

This implementation has each boid use the Unity Physics system to locate its neighnours inside its own update loop.

The obvious target for reducing 


 
Wanted to make something that actually leverages the job system to do something other than just have many entities doing a basic task

obvious choice is boids. Lot of implementations of boids in raw C#, 
lots of attempts to optimise it, such as Sebastian Lague here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw&ab_channel=SebastianLague

boids core code was taken from here: https://github.com/keijiro/Boids/tree/7eb25a1a5a65a04427bbb4070184c59a4af7b354

step 1: Base Line Boids - 50 boids tanks frame rate to 50fps. Bad!

Step 2: Basic job for calculating needed info than paralel job for movement
